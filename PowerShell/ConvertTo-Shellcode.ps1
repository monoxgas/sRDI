Function ConvertTo-Shellcode{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Convert DLL file to position independent shellcode

    Author: Nick Landers (@monoxgas)
    License: BSD 3-Clause
    Required Dependencies: None
    Optional Dependencies: Invoke-Shellcode.ps1

    .DESCRIPTION
    Uses ShellcodeRDI to bootstrap and shellcode PE loader to an existing file. When
    execution is passed to the converted shellcode, the DLL file is unpacked and loaded
    in memory.

    .EXAMPLE
    C:\PS> ConvertTo-Shellcode -File TestDLL_x86.dll

    .EXAMPLE
    C:\PS> ConvertTo-Shellcode -File MyTool.dll -FunctionName "MyExport" -UserData "MyDataForMyExport"

    .EXAMPLE
    C:\PS> import-module .\Invoke-Shellcode.ps1
    C:\PS> Invoke-Shellcode -Shellcode (ConvertTo-Shellcode TestDLL_x64.dll -ClearHeader)

    .PARAMETER File
    The target DLL file to convert

    .PARAMETER FunctionName
    Name of the exported function to call after DLLMain

    .PARAMETER UserData
    Data to pass to the target function

    .PARAMETER ClearHeader
    Clear the PE header on load

    .PARAMETER ObfuscateImports
    Randomize import dependency load order

    .PARAMETER ImportDelay
    Number of seconds to pause between loading imports (requires -ObfuscateImports)
